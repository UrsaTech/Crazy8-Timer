Hey so my new feature idea is ultra boring, but necessary functionality for production apps. It's form validation. I actually implemented it before I wrote this. I did so in such a way as to allow the extension of the home page component to include more settings, each as an instance of a possible class with an isValid flag and a custom validator method. I know that Angular 2 comes with its own validation library, but I'm not familiar with it and I didn't think I should spend my alloted time researching an advanced topic like that.
