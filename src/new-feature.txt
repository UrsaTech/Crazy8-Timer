New Feature. Implemented.

When people create sketches, it can be very sudden that they don't have time left.
I think that it would be convenient to hear several warning signals and see red color before timeout.
For example, during last 5 seconds users should here 5 warning signals every second.
The color of text should be changed to red.
Also users can adjust the moment when they should be warned.
